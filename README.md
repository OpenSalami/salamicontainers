# THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH! THIS IS WHERE ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS! CONSIDER THE IMAGES BUILD FROM THIS BRANCH UNSTABLE!

# salamicontainers

A catalog of images I have been curated. Mostly from a fork of the Bitnami catalog.

## Contents

The repo contains mostly two different flavors of containers: the original Bitnami image (based on Debian), and a self-composed "Thin-Image" built from scratch. The scratch image is smaller in size and has less exposure to vulnerabilities due to a minimum of installed packages.
